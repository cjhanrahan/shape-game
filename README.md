# Shape Game

A game where you have to guess which 3D shape has a bigger volume!

I am working on this to achieve these goals:

- Get practice with NextJS, ThreeJS
- To improve my understanding of 3D graphics, geometry and linear algebra
- Have fun!

Still in development, many more features to come.

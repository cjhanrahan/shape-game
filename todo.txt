add shiny material
make the shapes print volume information
should two shapes really be in app container?
make loading state more useful
add different geometry tests


each round:
    pick two shapes
    pick two sizes (at least 5% distance)
    pick dimension ratios
    get geometry

shape definition:
    first dimension is 1
    all other dimensions have ranges

shape class:
    range of relative sizes of dimensions
    absolute volume + specified relative size = absolute dimensions
    absolute dimensions => three geometry

relative size of dimensions
    volume
    mins/maxes for dimensions relative size
    given volume, what

pick shape, pick size,
